# EsquisSons
Esquissons is a grasshopper plugin and a standalone app which help you to design with sound ;)

> Comes with an installer here : https://www.food4rhino.com/app/esquissons
> Crossplatform (Mac/windows) 

## Functions/component :
Listener : Place/Move the listening point in the scene, choose its orientation and size

Geometry : Determine the phonic opacity of a geometry but also its absorption coefficient

Sources : Position the source in the model, determine its size and choose the sound file it will play

Option for sources : Mute a source, manually adjust its volume and choose the degree of shuffle!

Built-in Sound : New simpler interface in the form of a list to access the built-in sounds. (more built-in sounds)

Main Engine : Optimized component (faster), you can lock the sources, enable or disable reverb, and choose between an indoor or outdoor sketch. The component returns, in addition to the sound, a visualization in the form of rays as well as the reverberation time per source and the amount of reverberation (mix) per source. 

Visualize Rays : You can choose how many rays are visible, at what distance from the source and the number of bounces you want to see !
